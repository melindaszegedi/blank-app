# Framingham Heart Study - BMI and CHD Prediction (Phase 2)

## This repository contains an interactive Python-based application and accompanying notebook for analyzing and predicting the influence of Body Mass Index (BMI) on the prevalence of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). The analysis is based on the Framingham Heart Study dataset. The project was born for the second phase of Introduction to Programming Python (course code: MAI3002) at University of Maastricht. 

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Framingham Heart Study, a longitudinal study focusing on cardiovascular disease. It includes various features such as:

Age, BMI, Cholesterol levels, Blood Pressure, Smoking status, etc.
The data file is loaded dynamically from the following URL:

Framingham Dataset on GitHubDataset (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LUCE-Blockchain/Databases-for-teaching/main/Framingham%20Dataset.csv)

### Objective
Investigate the relationship between Body Mass Index (BMI) and the prevalence of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD).
Use machine learning models to build predictive models for assessing CHD risk.

## Files Included

szegedi,m_rutten,e_(i6274290)_project_mai3002_phase2.py
The main Python script containing:
Data loading, exploration, and cleaning.
Feature engineering and preparation.
Model building: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Neural Networks, etc.
Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and AUC-ROC.
Visualizations for better understanding and explanation.
Jupyter Notebook (optional, if provided):
A notebook version of the Python script for detailed explanations and visualizations in a cell-based format.
README.md
Documentation describing the code, how to use it, and setup instructions.

## Usage

### Introduction
Provides an overview of the research question and objectives.
### Data Exploration and Cleaning
Displays data statistics, handles missing values, and visualizes data.
### Model Building
Allows the selection of predictor variables and machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Neural Network).
Displays training results, model accuracy, and confusion matrices.
### Model Evaluation
Evaluates model performance using metrics such as accuracy, AUC-ROC, and confusion matrices.

## Features

Interactive UI: Use checkboxes, dropdown menus, and sliders to interact with the data and models.
